# Moistello Contracts — Agent Guidelines

You are an elite Rust/Soroban and Go engineer building the Moistello smart contract ecosystem. The contracts are deployed to Stellar's Soroban platform and consumed by the Go backend.

Follow these directives strictly. Every deviation must be explicitly justified.

---

## 1. PRIME DIRECTIVES

### 1.1 Enterprise Quality Only
- Every line of code must be production-grade. No stubs, no placeholders, no TODOs unless part of a documented phase boundary.
- Every function must handle errors explicitly. No `unwrap()` in production code.
- Every error must be typed (not string-based). Use proper error enums with variants.
- Every storage read/write must have explicit lifetime considerations (instance vs persistent vs temporary).

### 1.2 Test-Driven Everything
- Write tests BEFORE implementation logic where possible.
- Every contract function must have: happy path test, edge case test, failure mode test, access control test.
- Target 95%+ line coverage on contracts.
- Use Soroban SDK's test framework (not mocks for contracts — test against real local ledger).

### 1.3 Security First
- Every mutating function MUST have access control checks FIRST, before any state changes.
- Use the common access control module. No inline auth checks.
- Validate ALL inputs before touching storage (check → compute → write pattern).
- Integer overflow protection: use Soroban SDK's safe math or explicit overflow checks.
- Reentrancy protection: never invoke external contracts during state mutation.
- Emergency pause: every contract must support pause/unpause via admin.

### 1.4 Gas Optimization
- Minimize storage operations (reads + writes). Batch where possible.
- Use instance storage for small, frequently-accessed data (< 64 bytes).
- Use persistent storage for large data (member lists, round history).
- Pre-compute derived values at write time, not read time.
- Short field names in events to reduce log gas costs.

### 1.5 Immutability + Upgradability
- Contracts deploy once. State persists forever.
- Use the proxy + implementation pattern from `common/upgrade.rs`.
- Admin auth required for upgrades.
- Never lose state during upgrades — store state in proxy, not implementation.

---

## 2. CODE STANDARDS

### 2.1 Rust Standards
```rust
// ✓ GOOD — typed errors, access control, safe math
pub fn contribute(env: Env, member: Address, amount: i128, round: u32) -> Result<(), CircleError> {
    member.require_auth();
    let circle = load_circle(&env)?;
    validate_active(&circle)?;
    validate_member(&env, &member, &circle)?;
    validate_round(&circle, round)?;
    validate_amount(amount, circle.contribution_amount)?;
    
    record_contribution(&env, &member, round, amount)?;
    
    env.events().publish((circle.id.clone(),), ContributionReceived {
        member: member.clone(),
        round,
        amount,
    });
    Ok(())
}

// ✗ BAD — no error type, no auth, no validation, unwrap
pub fn contribute(env: Env, amount: i128) {
    let c: Circle = env.storage().instance().get(&DataKey::Circle).unwrap();
    c.contributions.push(amount);
    env.storage().instance().set(&DataKey::Circle, &c);
}
```

### 2.2 Error Enums — Always Typed
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
#[contracterror]
pub enum CircleError {
    NotActive = 1,
    CircleFull = 2,
    AlreadyMember = 3,
    NotMember = 4,
    InsufficientMoiScore = 5,
    RoundNotCurrent = 6,
    InvalidAmount = 7,
    PaymentDeadlinePassed = 8,
    MaxStrikesReached = 9,
    NotOrganizer = 10,
    ContractPaused = 11,
    InvalidInviteCode = 12,
    AuctionAlreadyResolved = 13,
    VoteQuorumNotMet = 14,
    // ... every possible failure mode gets a variant
}
```

### 2.3 Event Emissions
```rust
// Every state change emits an event. Events are the source of truth for the indexer.
// Format: (topic_symbol, data), where topic is contract-address scoped.

env.events().publish(
    (symbol_short!("contribute"),), 
    ContributionReceived { member, round, amount }
);

// Always use short symbol names — saves gas.
// Events must carry enough data for the indexer to reconstruct state.
```

### 2.4 Storage Layout
```rust
// Explicit storage key enums — never use string keys
#[derive(Clone)]
#[contracttype]
pub enum DataKey {
    CircleConfig,       // CircleConfig — once, at init
    Members,            // Vec<Member> — persistent, grows
    Contributions,      // Vec<Contribution> — persistent, grows per round
    PayoutBitmap,       // u128 bitmask — which positions have been paid
    CurrentRound,       // u32 — instance storage
    Collateral,         // Map<Address, i128> — member stakes
    Paused,            // bool — emergency
}
```

---

## 3. IMPLEMENTATION ORDER (MUST FOLLOW)

### Phase 1: Common Library First
1. `common/` — Build shared types, VRF, math, access control, pause, upgrade proxy
2. All contracts depend on `common`. Nothing else is built first.

### Phase 2: Core Contracts
3. `circle-factory/` — Factory deploys circles. Frame the registry.
4. `circle/` — The big one. All 12 functions. All 4 payout types. Heavy test coverage.
5. `reputation-registry/` — MoiScore calculation. Depends on circle events via callback.

### Phase 3: Supporting Contracts  
6. `treasury/` — Fee collection. Depends on factory fee config.

### Phase 4: Deployment + Bindings
8. Build → optimize → deploy to testnet
9. Generate Go bindings from deployed contract specs
10. Verify all contracts on-chain

---

## 4. TESTING STANDARDS

### 4.1 Contract Unit Tests (cargo test)
```rust
#[test]
fn test_contribute_happy_path() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let admin = Address::generate(&env);
    let member = Address::generate(&env);
    
    // Setup: deploy circle with 1 member
    let contract = deploy_test_circle(&env, &admin, 5);
    join_as_member(&env, &contract, &member, 1);
    
    // Act
    let result = contract.contribute(&member, 100_0000000, 1);
    
    // Assert
    assert!(result.is_ok());
    let contributions = contract.get_contributions(&member);
    assert_eq!(contributions.len(), 1);
    assert_eq!(contributions[0].amount, 100_0000000);
}

#[test]
fn test_contribute_wrong_amount() {
    // Contribution must match circle config exactly
    let contract = deploy_test_circle(&env, &admin, 5);
    let result = contract.contribute(&member, 50_0000000, 1);  // wrong amount
    assert_eq!(result, Err(Ok(CircleError::InvalidAmount)));
}

#[test]
fn test_contribute_not_member() { /* ... */ }
#[test]
fn test_contribute_round_mismatch() { /* ... */ }
#[test]
fn test_contribute_past_deadline() { /* ... */ }
```

### 4.2 Integration Tests (multi-contract)
```rust
#[test]
fn test_full_circle_lifecycle() {
    let env = Env::default();
    
    // 1. Deploy factory
    let factory = deploy_factory(&env);
    
    // 2. Create circle via factory
    let config = CircleConfig { /* ... */ };
    let circle_id = factory.deploy_circle(&admin, config);
    let circle = CircleClient::new(&env, &circle_id);
    
    // 3. 5 members join
    for i in 0..5 {
        let member = Address::generate(&env);
        circle.join(&member, None);
    }
    
    // 4. Each member contributes for 5 rounds
    for round in 0..5 {
        for member in members.iter() {
            circle.contribute(member, config.amount, round);
        }
        circle.trigger_payout(round);
    }
    
    // 5. Verify circle completed
    assert_eq!(circle.get_status(), CircleStatus::Completed);
    assert_eq!(circle.get_completed_rounds(), 5);
}
```

### 4.3 Fuzz Testing
```rust
#[test]
fn fuzz_contribution_amounts() {
    // Fuzz random contribution amounts — must NOT panic
    // Must return proper errors for invalid amounts
    proptest!(|(amount: i128)| {
        let result = contract.contribute(&member, amount, 1);
        // Must never panic — always return Result
    });
}
```

---

## 5. Go BACKEND INTEGRATION

### 5.1 Contract IDs in Config
```yaml
# moistello-backend/config/config.yaml
stellar:
  testnet:
    circle_factory_contract_id: "CDEF..."
    circle_wasm_hash: "abc123..."
    reputation_contract_id: "GHIJ..."
    treasury_contract_id: "OPQR..."
```

### 5.2 Error Classification
```go
// Map Soroban contract errors to Go domain errors
func ClassifySorobanError(scErr *SorobanContractError) error {
    switch scErr.Code {
    case 1:  return apperrors.ErrCircleNotActive
    case 2:  return apperrors.ErrCircleFull
    case 3:  return apperrors.ErrAlreadyMember
    case 5:  return apperrors.ErrMoiScoreTooLow
    case 10: return apperrors.ErrNotOrganizer
    case 11: return apperrors.ErrContractPaused
    default: return fmt.Errorf("contract error %d: %s", scErr.Code, scErr.Message)
    }
}
```

### 5.3 NEVER Do This
```go
// ✗ NEVER store secret keys in Go source code
const masterSecret = "SDBB..."

// ✗ NEVER hardcode contract IDs
circleContract := "CDEF..."

// ✓ Use config
cfg.Stellar.MasterSecretKey  // from env var
cfg.Stellar.CircleFactoryContractID  // from config.yaml
```

## 6. PERFORMANCE BUDGETS

| Operation | Gas Budget (testnet) | Time Budget |
|---|---|---|
| Deploy circle | < 500,000 | < 5s |
| Join circle | < 100,000 | < 2s |
| Contribute | < 80,000 | < 2s |
| Payout (random) | < 150,000 | < 3s |
| Payout (auction) | < 200,000 | < 3s |
| Get status (read) | < 5,000 | < 0.5s |

---

## 7. PHASE GATES — DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT

| Phase | Gate | Must Pass |
|---|---|---|
| 1→2 | All contracts compile + pass unit tests | `cargo test --workspace` |
| 2→3 | Contracts deployed to testnet | `scripts/deploy.sh testnet` succeeds |
| 3→4 | Go client makes real testnet calls | `go test ./pkg/stellar/soroban/...` against testnet |
| 4→5 | Load test passes | 100 concurrent users, < 1% failure |
| 5 | All deliverables complete | See PLANS.md Phase 5 checklist |

---

## 8. AGGRESSIVE PHASE TESTING — MANDATORY GATE

**No phase is complete until every component implemented in that phase passes extreme aggressive testing. Do NOT mark any phase as complete without this.**

### 8.1 What "Extreme Aggressive Testing" Means

For every component (contract, function, Go module, indexer unit), you MUST test:

| Dimension | Minimum Required |
|---|---|
| **Happy path** | All valid inputs produce expected outputs |
| **Edge cases** | Zero values, max values, empty collections, boundary conditions |
| **Failure modes** | Every error variant triggered and verified |
| **Access control** | Unauthorized callers rejected for every mutating function |
| **Concurrency** | Race conditions tested (Go: `-race` flag) |
| **State corruption** | Invalid state transitions rejected |
| **Gas limits** | Every contract function verified within budget |
| **Input fuzzing** | Random/malformed inputs must NEVER panic — always return typed errors |
| **Network failures** | Simulated RPC timeouts, connection resets, reorgs |
| **Resource exhaustion** | Large inputs (100 members, 100 rounds), deep nesting |
| **Regression** | Previous passing tests must still pass |

### 8.2 Phase-Specific Testing Requirements

| Phase | Components | Aggressive Test Protocol |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** | All 5 Rust contracts | `cargo test --workspace` must pass with 95%+ coverage. Every function must have: happy path ×1, edge case ×2, failure mode ×3, access control ×1. Fuzz test contribution amounts and member counts. Test all 4 payout types with 10-member circles. Deploy each contract to local Soroban ledger and run full lifecycle. |
| **Phase 2** | Go contract client (15 files) | `go test ./pkg/stellar/... -race -count=5` must pass 5 consecutive times with zero race conditions. Test against real testnet with your account. Simulate: network timeout, invalid sequence, insufficient balance, contract error, transaction expired. Submit 50 rapid-fire transactions — verify zero sequence gaps. |
| **Phase 3** | Indexer engine (7 files) | Replay 100 ledgers of known events — verify 100% captured, zero duplicates. Test cursor rollback on chain reorg. Test reconciler gap detection. Test DB connection loss + recovery. Test RabbitMQ disconnect + reconnect. Run for 1 hour continuously — verify memory stable, no goroutine leaks. |
| **Phase 4** | Hardening (upgrade, pause, load, soak) | Deploy v1 → upgrade to v2 → verify state preserved. Pause contract → verify all mutating functions reject → unpause → verify resume. Load test: k6 with 100 VUs for 5 minutes, p95 < 2s, < 1% failures. Soak test: 24-hour run, log memory/goroutine/connection pool every hour. |

### 8.3 Test Execution Rules

```
1. Tests run in FRESH environment — no cached state from previous runs
2. Tests run with RACE DETECTOR enabled (go test -race, cargo test with sanitizers)
3. Tests run MULTIPLE TIMES — flaky tests are broken tests
4. Tests ASSERT, not print — every check is an assertion that fails the build
5. Tests output COVERAGE — must meet 95%+ for contracts, 85%+ for Go
6. Test failures BLOCK the phase — no proceeding until all pass
7. Test results are DOCUMENTED in the phase completion report
```

### 8.4 Phase Completion Report Template

Before marking any phase complete, produce a report containing:

```
Phase X Completion Report
=========================
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Components Tested: [list every file]
Total Tests: N
Passed: N
Failed: 0
Coverage: XX%
Race Detector: CLEAN

Per-Component Breakdown:
  component_a:
    - Happy path: ✓ (N tests)
    - Edge cases: ✓ (N tests)  
    - Failure modes: ✓ (N tests)
    - Access control: ✓ (N tests)
    - Concurrency: ✓ (N tests, -race clean)
    - Gas within budget: ✓ (max: X, budget: Y)

  component_b:
    [same breakdown]

Issues Found: 0
Blockers: None
Phase Status: COMPLETE ✓
```

### 8.5 NEVER Mark a Phase Complete If

- Any test fails (no skipping, no `#[ignore]`)
- Coverage is below the threshold
- Race detector shows any warnings
- A function was implemented but not tested
- Error paths are untested ("return err" with no test triggering it)
- The phase completion report has not been produced
- Any component shows a gas usage above budget without explanation

## 9. CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERNS

| Anti-Pattern | Why It's Dangerous | Correct Approach |
|---|---|---|
| `unwrap()` in contract code | Panics destroy state and lock funds permanently | Return `Result<_, ContractError>` always |
| String-based error messages | Not machine-readable, no classification | Use typed error enums with numeric codes |
| Hardcoded addresses | Breaks across networks | Use config/constructor injection |
| Storing large arrays in instance storage | Instance storage is expensive and limited | Use persistent storage for collections |
| No replay protection on contributions | Double-spend risk | Check contribution uniqueness per round |
| Skipping simulation before submit | Wastes gas on broken transactions | Always simulate → apply → sign → submit |
| No sequence manager | Sequence gaps break all subsequent transactions | Use AccountManager with mutex |

---

## 10. REFERENCE: Quick Commands

```bash
# Contracts
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
cargo test --workspace
soroban contract optimize --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/circle.wasm
soroban contract deploy --wasm circle.optimized.wasm --source admin --network testnet

# Backend
cd ../moistello-backend
go test ./pkg/stellar/soroban/... -v -count=1
go test ./internal/indexer/... -v -count=1
go test ./... -count=1
```

---

## 11. FINAL RULE

**If you don't know the exact Soroban SDK API, look it up. Never guess.**

The SDK changes. The Stellar docs at https://developers.stellar.org/docs/smart-contracts are the source of truth. Read the actual SDK source if needed. A wrong API call that compiles but fails at runtime on-chain wastes real testnet XLM and developer time.
