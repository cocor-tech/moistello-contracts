//! Centralized token transfer helper with error mapping

//! Issue #517: All token transfers across contracts should use this helper
//! to ensure consistent error handling and never silently succeed.

/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(())` on successful transfer
/// * `Err(TokenTransferError)` on any failure
/// 
/// # Panics
/// Never panics - all failures are returned as errors
